Like we have to see how it trades but it looks pretty likely the Fed is going to set near term direction with either a breakout rally or a breakdown and if we get a break down it's almost certainly going to line up with some type of rejection off the 200 day which is actually really not a good sign at all.

We\u2019ve had a lot of delay, delay, delay, with regards to economic policy and geopolitical stability, but so far the only thing that\u2019s actually come about is a stock market correction and decreased consumer confidence. \n\nKeeping an entire country in limbo about what its core economic policy will even be is asinine. On a macro level everything is fucked for the simple fact that there is no macro to even reference. Yet the fed still has to make a determination on rates in the absence of any meaningful, consistent data or policy.\n\nMy expectations for what the fed will do is out of the window, I\u2019m throwing away any preconceived ideas for what rate decisions will look like this year and I\u2019m simply going to play the volatility around the events.

Here\u2019s two that I\u2019m long only on*: \n\nRolls Royce has been on a tear for a few years, driven by an impressive turn around, covid recovery and the emerging promise of small modular reactors as a sustainable and affordable solution to the energy crisis. The recent up swing from a defence point of view is relatively small in the grand scheme of things. I can see them climbing much much higher. My personal price target is \u00a312/share. It\u2019s currently circa \u00a38, so 50% upside. \n\nSimilarly, Babcock in the UK have a huge amount of defence exposure and have done well in the recent rally, but are at a modest PE, have also worked to refocus their core business, and stand to do very well wrt any European ground based defence force thanks to their expertise with keeping older armoured and infantry fighting vehicles and suchlike in service. I see this climbing to \u00a310/share. Approx 40% upside. \n\n*UK based regards typically invest personally via ISAs for tax efficiency and so options trading is less common. There are probably options to do this, but reference my name, I\u2019m old as fuck and can\u2019t be arsed with leveraged gambling.",

            "I don\u2019t think it\u2019s in a bubble. A lot of the defense spending is going to shift to European defense companies from American, no one trusts the US anymore.

            "There are loopholes that this multi billion dollar enterprise will try to exploit and defend legally before they cease compounding. Compounding is still allowed for non shortage medication if either the patient requires a specific personalized dose or if mixed with another prescribed medication. In practice this means, that the compounders will either produce odd doses like 0.375mg instead of 0.25 and 0.5 and argue that this is necessary. Or they will mix the medication with something irrelevant like vitamin b12 and argue this mix is medically necessary.\n\n\nThis is obviously a bomb under the entire pharma industry if allowed to continue, as no medication is then effectively protected by the patents. There is full on legal crises mode behind the curtains with unlikely alliances forming and lawyers licking their lips at the expectation of the legal fees gathered in the upcoming legal war.\n\n\nSource: trust me bro",

I know at least ETRADE restricts trades for 16:00-16:01 - I assumed due to immense closing volume for the entire market.\n\n  \nthat looks like those are 5-minute bars so that's 10mins of heavy selling. curious to see the volume at those times too.  given the sudden light trading I imagine that the order book would have a ton of entries removed causing any \"market\" orders to match at lower prices.  \n\n  \ntracking what's happening around this time is quite difficult - grab a large portion of the order book and timestamp everything as it changes.  filled orders you will see, and you should also see a bunch of entries get removed by the matching engine right at the close.  if you are seeing trades execute , check their time stamp and the timestamp you got things, you may be seeing a race condition on the matching engine... if you do, it's possible to game it by entering buy orders good for the day, and sell orders good for after-hours trading (or inverse it).\n\n\n\nit looks like someone else figured it out too, there are also likely a pile-up of these type of orders which are triggered immediately following the close. something you can play with...",

            "I don't know if I'm reading what you wrote wrong but I understood that you think the LEO constellation OneWeb isn't up and running and is planned? Although its unfinished it is running. \n\nOneWeb works, and its the only real StarLink alternative LEO constellation they just need to add to it.  I suggest you read around the UK / French Sale ( [https://www.gov.uk/government/news/oneweb-merger-with-eutelsat](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/oneweb-merger-with-eutelsat)  ), the fact the UK retained a sovereign share, and StarLink's early association with it (Elon Musk was an early business partner, he went away and built his own - read about it on wiki). \n\nI don't want to speculate too much on undervalued as there's forward capital needs with sattelites. Market cap is only 3bn and that was the value for OneWeb alone and the UK thought it took a write-down then. \n\nEutelsat was initially valued this year as if there was no real demand for competition against Starlink, based on the flawed assumption that Starlink would be seen as both neutral and sovereign. Many believed Eutelsat would struggle to secure the necessary capital to expand or replace its LEO constellation. Analysts examined its credit rating, revenue trends, and retreat from the consumer market and concluded, \u201cShort it.\u201d Goldman Sachs analyst now humble: [https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/goldman-says-sell-rating-on-eutelsat-stock-was-the-wrong-call-ups-to-neutral-3915514](https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/goldman-says-sell-rating-on-eutelsat-stock-was-the-wrong-call-ups-to-neutral-3915514) \n\nThat turned out to be a mistake\u2014at least at the price it reached, which dropped well below book value and significantly underperformed competitors in GEO/MEO like SESG. Now, with the stock rebounding to \u20ac6, shifting recommendations to neutral or hold is effectively supporting the price. Analysts are now suggesting that the recent uptick might be justified.\n\n**And yes, the EU has its own lunch capacity via ESA / ArianeSpace, and its partnering with Rocketlabs for certain things:** [https://www.rocketlabusa.com/updates/airbus-awards-rocket-lab-contract-to-power-next-gen-oneweb-constellation-for-eutelsat/](https://www.rocketlabusa.com/updates/airbus-awards-rocket-lab-contract-to-power-next-gen-oneweb-constellation-for-eutelsat/) \\- SpaceX isn't the only launch capacity in town, though it may be cheaper ;) \n\nStrong speculative play revealed by many governments now worrying about dependence on one vendor. As they should ;)",

Provides coverage for large areas but not ideal for consumers needing low-latency internet.\n* **Pricing**: Varies, often more expensive due to enterprise-focused services.\n\n**Starlink**:\n\n* **Satellite Type**: Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites, around 550-1,200 km above Earth.\n* **Speed**: 100-200 Mbps with low latency (20-40 ms), ideal for real-time applications like gaming, video calls, and streaming.\n* **Target Audience**: Designed for **consumers** in **rural and remote areas** where traditional broadband is unavailable.\n* **Pricing**: Affordable, around **$110/month**, with setup costs of around **$549** for equipment.\n\n**Summary**:\n\n* **Eutelsat** is ideal for **businesses** and **government** users needing satellite services.\n* **Starlink** is best for **individuals** or **families** in remote areas looking for affordable, high-speed internet.\n\nSome chatgtp quick stats. The more detailed one shows Eutelstat more expensive, higher based satellites which can cause a lot more latency than startlink. Something like 100-200ms or more latency compared to Starlinks lower range satellites which has 20-40ms latency. I can see why many armies would prefer the lower latency connections."

            "\u201cThe new deal could also mean a windfall for Ukraine. Under the plan, defense spending exceeding 1 percent of gross domestic product will be exempted from the strictures of the country\u2019s strict debt brake, which drastically limits the structural budget deficit. But under the latest draft, that exemption also now includes aid for countries unlawfully attacked under international law \u2014 one of the key demands of the Greens.\u201d\n \n\u201cThat means, assuming the plan passes through parliament as now expected, Germany will be able to provide many billions in aid to Ukraine through borrowing. Spending to counteract cyber threats as well as intelligence services will also be included under the debt-brake exemption, said Merz.\u201c\n\nKeep pumping those EU Defense stocks!",

            "I've been to a dollar general exactly one time in my life and that was within the last month. The only reason I went was because it was close and I could expense what I was buying. I have no idea why anyone actually shops there enough to be a regular customer. Everything is extremely expensive for the quantity and the stores are shitholes. Is it just a store that survives on people being absolutely shit at simple math?",
            "Aren't the dollar store consumers always strapped for cash? I thought catering to cash strapped customers was their business model. DG and DLTR stock prices are where they were 10 yrs ago, their problems are multifold - stores that look like hurricanes pass through them routinely, rampant thefts because there is never enough staff, price for subpar products that doesn't make sense when Walmart, Aldi and others sell for cheaper when adjusted to quantity to name a few. Its almost like the only reason they are still in business is because no big box retailer will open a store in rural America.",

Usually, hundreds upon hundreds of poor idiots flock to us to give us their tax return money so they can \u201crent\u201d a car for a few weeks before we repo it and sell it to the next sucker. \n\nWE.  ARE.  DEAD. \n\nWe went from doing 200+ car deals weekly with each deal producing thousands of dollars in down payment\u2026. To doing 80 cars in a week with minimal down, IF we\u2019re lucky. \n\nThis economy is going to crash. Position yourselves accordingly.",
            "Another reason why i say that the bullshit bubble in tech must burst.  \nPeople simply don't have money for dicking around with shit like Bitcoin or vaporwar from Tesler.\n\nSo, if you would pretty please short the shit out of TSLA and MSTR and help the world move on and invest in things that make sense?\n\nPreparing civilization to expand into space is something that can be done, but must mean to increase production, automate as much work as possible and start building an exostructure for earth, i.e., the damn space elevator.\n\nAs of right now, the most profitable expansion in production is probably water irrigation to regreen deserts, particularly in africa.   \nPlant a fucking seed and let the plant do the production for you.\n\nShit like that can all be done and everyone on the planet gets rich in the process. Musks 'vision' of just sending over rockets to Mars is regarded. Why is no one saying anything?",
            "Dollar General, Five Below, Dollar Tree, etc. all pay $10.00 an hour.\n\nI heard working there is hell and you\u2019re usually the only one working. People will walk out mid shift and the store will just be \u2018abandoned\u2019 because they refuse to staff more.\n\nBut don\u2019t worry their profits are still up and the higher ups can buy those yachts.",

            "When I had started, I noticed a pattern, where there was a lot of volatility in the stock. Even though it was, in general, always on the decline over a longer period of time, it would seem to regularly swing between high and low points that were pretty generously far away from each other. So even though it was trending downward, day to day, the same price point(s) would be met again, and again, and again, to where I had a pretty high level of confidence as far as where it might bottom out, and where it might top out at. It was always a moving target, but it was something I could feel pretty confident about. Back then I didn't have the confidence to buy shares directly, so I used to just sell put options when it was at a low point, being very, very certain that it wouldn't end up going far enough below that floor (say if something unexpected happened) to eat through the premium of the put options I was selling. I would just sell them on 30-ish day expiration dates, and then wait for the stock price to go back up like it always seemed to do, and buy-to-close my contracts early if the profit was good enough.\n\nThere were some moments that freaked me out where things looked very bad, for instance, whenever orange man would make some comments on twitter that would spook the market (I'm not getting political on that, there were very specific moments where things he said did impact the price of things on the market temporarily, regardless of whether i'm for or against him), so there were some moments where I thought I was going to lose a lot, but overall things worked out in the end. At some point I stopped trading and went back to a normal day job, because prices in my local area have gone up so much that I can't pay the bills just trading anyways and I was getting stressed over depending on it for an income.\n\nThat pattern that I had seen originally does not seem to hold true very recently, but still. I like the stock.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/l9c1bftchioe1.png?width=1620&format=png&auto=webp&s=359c3c33857c4f03c4ffe92827a8e3f62407efd5\n\n**Edit**: Oh, also, this specific stock, had a low enough price point that made it attractive for me to sell options contracts without needing an outrageous balance to cover them, while still having room for selling put options on the next lower price increment, with that increment being a price point that the stock might reasonably drop to (so there was a reasonable price assigned to that contract)"

            "I got in and back out early on this one. We use their product at work, and it feels like none of it is fully fleshed out. They change their licensing and pricing model so fast that the sales people don\u2019t even know what is going on half the time. \n\nTheir cloud AI products aren\u2019t exactly new. They have had the same technology for years in their on prem solutions, and they were terrible. Hard to use, did not produce results, and some were even decommissioned completely in favor of the cloud alternatives. It feels like you are being forced to their cloud solution, and in order to take advantage of what they are selling you, you have to fully utilize the suite from idea inception to deployment. \n\nI can go on and on about this company lol. The RPA solution is great, but they are open about ditching that for AI. Which was clunky and slow when we tried it. It was easier to just sit a person down for 2 hours with the person their robot was supposed to monitor, instead of waiting the 2-4 weeks for the robot to tell me the same information in a less digestible way.

            "\ud83c\udf97\ufe0f Reminder to all traders \n\n- https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/rule-10b5-1.asp\n\n> _\"Rule 10b5-1 is a Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regulation that allows insiders of public companies to set up a trading plan for selling stocks they own. Rule 10b5-1 permits major holders to sell a predetermined number of shares at a predetermined time. Many corporate executives use 10b5-1 plans to avoid accusations of insider trading.\"_\n\nAnytime a scary article or post shows up about a high up person selling millions in stock, first consider this. These FUD articles usually rely on the fact most people don't know about this rule. You should assume this rule is in effect unless you have evidence to the contrary or evidence of foul play.\n\n_EDIT: Note that I did not remove this post nor lock this comment to prevent replies. I just want to be sure everyone knows about 10b5-1. Feel free to disagree and talk about loopholes and all that. I'm not a Reddit employee or holding any positions in RDDT, I don't have any money at risk if this platform disappears tomorrow._",
