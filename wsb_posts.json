Wiz and its investors balked at the deal in part because of worries of a protracted regulatory approval process, with competition authorities in the US and Europe focusing on the tech sector for its economic sway and market power. \n\n> Chief Executive Officer Assaf Rappaport, who described last year\u2019s offer as \u201chumbling,\u201d also said he relished the idea of growing Wiz into an independent cybersecurity giant, to compete against the likes of CrowdStrike Holdings Inc. and Palo Alto Networks.\n\n> Started by Israelis and based in New York, Wiz\u2019s investors include Sequoia Capital, Index Ventures, Insight Partners and Cyberstarts.

Like we have to see how it trades but it looks pretty likely the Fed is going to set near term direction with either a breakout rally or a breakdown and if we get a break down it's almost certainly going to line up with some type of rejection off the 200 day which is actually really not a good sign at all.

With growth to continue through this year as an expansion ramps up in Q2. Gold has also risen an additional $250/oz since.\n\n$72 million x4= $288mil cash flow. Convert to CAD is $412mil. KNT.TO currently has a $2.7 billion market cap. It\u2019s trading at a mere 6x cash flow. This isn\u2019t factoring future production at a now higher gold price, this would add an additional $15mil/quarter cash flow.\n\nI think now that earnings are released and as market processes them KNT will go on a run all week to $13-14 range. IV has dropped and option premiums are dirt cheap. As I write this you can buy ITM $11 calls for $.45, only $0.08 premium. A run to $13 will 4x your money.\n\nMy position is:\n2k shares\n30 calls at $10 March\n10 calls $11 March\n10 calls $12 April",

        "title": "My black swan has her wings - LMT into the toilet make puts go BOOM!",
        "text": "ETA: My thesis applies to LMT for the period from 3/17/25 through end of May 2025. More or less an earnings play but I'm not sure if the drop will be before, on or after earnings.\n\nETA: some additional context at the bottom of the post that address legitimate questions that I think I can answer from comments\n\nETA: Updated my position to reflect adding another put option. To me on this day (3/17/2025) the market seems like it wants to keep trading back up to test 5737, maybe as high as 5809, before we see the next leg down. So I will add more as we approach those levels.\n\n\\-------------------------------------\n\nI could write a separate post about why I think we are about to experience a black swan event (or really a black swan period) and I'm not sure if this particular point I am going to discuss will cause it. Either way there is a ton of money to be made on LMT in the next few hours / days / weeks or months.\n\nHard to know exactly when the market will realize just how much POTUS has fucked up LMT's business and then from there I don't know if the market will immediately see the contagion risk for other US defense companies. It may take some time for this to sink in, not sure.\n\nOk so about LMT - Lockheed Martin is a defense contractor. The big thing to know for this is that they make the most expensive and capable fighter aircraft (war plane for shooting down other planes and/or dropping bombs) in the world. There are huge reliability and quality issues but end of the day nothing for sale by any company on the planet can beat it and nations across the globe (Canada, UK, Germany, many other nations across Europe, etc.) have placed orders ranging from a few billion dollars to hundreds of billions for F35 aircraft and after acquisition support and maintenance. The purchase price is roughly **$125,000,000** each (I'm not sure if that includes maintenance and support, I think maybe just support but there would be additional significant amounts of money going to LMT for maintenance over time).\n\nWith hundreds of billions of dollars of orders on the books, many more statements of intent from nations like Portugal, Turkiye, etc. and the associated revenue streams from maintenance, ammunition, etc. LMT has been looking pretty great since Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine which sent nations across the globe scrambling to buy the bets military tech they could afford.\n\nBut that brings us to today. Where things are suddenly changing drastically and in ways that are likely not reversible, at least not in any reasonable timeframe. The market hasn't yet priced this in and I don't know exactly when that will happen. Could be during the April earnings release. Could be tomorrow when trading begins. Could be anytime between now and then.\n\nSee the thing is; when you are a nation that has managed to pull together a couple of billion dollars to buy military aircraft that you intend to use for the next 20, 30 maybe even 40 years, you tend to really think through the decision. There are many factors involved; not the least of which is how reliant are you on the manufacturer (and the nation that manufacturer is based in) for support and maintenance.  Obviously if you can bring support and maintenance to your own nation then the dollars spent at least stay in your own country however that isn't always possible, especially with cutting edge top of the line systems, like the F35. Anyone who owns and operates the F35 platform will need unfettered access to LMT resources and specialists in order to get anywhere close to 100% of the benefit you might expect to get from having these in your air force. Just keeping them flying without access to LMT might prove impossible, let alone using all the fancy bells and whistles which in some cases rely on access to US military satellites in orbit.\n\nThe other piece to this puzzle is that these planes take A LONG time to build. Canada ordered 88 planes for about $9,000,000,000 back in 2023 and they are expected to get their first batch of 16 sometime next year. And they have only paid for those first 16 so not much they can do about that. But there are 72 F35 planes at roughly $125,000,000 a pop that they haven't paid for but LMT has in their order books. This is Canada I'm speaking about, the nation that POTUS keeps insisting will become part of the USA (whether they want to or not) and has been using economic extortion to try and extract trade concessions. That already made the idea of buying these additional 72 plans dicey but then you had POTUS suddenly cancel all military maintenance and support contracts between US defense contractors and Ukraine. This was walked back a bit but it made everybody sit up and think about the fact that POTUS was so mercurial that the idea of buying incredibly expensive weapons that could be hobbled on the word of POTUS maybe isn't the best idea.\n\nSince close of market on Friday the following has happened:\n\n1. The nation of Portugal (which had previously said they intended to buy some F35s) has announced they will look for alternatives that are manufactured in Europe. These aren't firm orders but they do represent part of the potential customer based for the F35.\n2. Then Turkiye, who has wanted to purchase the F35 for years and was prevented from doing so due to some geopolitical stuff announced that they would buy 40 fighter aircraft from the UK. Now these planes aren't nearly as good (or expensive as the F35) however the idea that Turkiye would invest what will end up being hundreds of millions of dollars into aircraft that aren't F35s and more importantly aren't from their usual military aircraft supplier (the USA) means that any future plans to purchase the F35 is now in doubt.\n3. Canada has now announced they intend to look for alternatives to the F35 instead of moving forward with the purchase of an additional 72 planes. I don't know if this will mean they are breaking a contract or maybe it is just rescinding a statement of intent. That is a question I don't have the answer to at the moment but it really doesn't matter. These were sales that are currently reflected in the LMT stock price that are now, for all intents and purposes, cancelled.\n\nSo that is my play - I am going to be buying more puts on LMT to add to what I already have over time (current position below)\n\nETA: Picked up June 20th $400P x1 on 3/17/2025\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8sccerz7s5pe1.png?width=1229&format=png&auto=webp&s=550517e5f82379d8e6f412d617ccb9a12bd68505\n\nI was already expecting a complete market crash as a result of POTUS' choices and actions. I've made some nice money in the last three weeks as a result. However I think we are just getting started and SOMETHING is going to lead to a bear market, possibly a depression. This thing with LMT could be the black swan that does it because when the market realizes the above is the reality of the situation there is a logical next thought: what about OTHER platforms and systems, whether made by LMT or other US defense contractors.\n\nBuying Patriot air defense systems or already own some and think you might need to buy some ammunition? Maybe time to look around at diversifying your supplier for anti aircraft and anti missile systems in case POTUS decides he doesn't like you.\n\nWhat about new tanks and armored transports? Probably not the kind of thing that relies as heavily on the manufacturer but spare parts and software updates will still be needed and if you have to switch to another supplier for additional vehicles down the road you will now have multiple platforms in operation which complicates logistics, training and operations, tactical operations, etc. That can impact decision making on new purchases.\n\nNaval vessels? Advanced radar systems to use on the weapons platform (that flies, drives or sails) which you are purchasing from a different manufacturer? These are the most complex technical systems on the planet and often have components from different manufacturers. LMT might make the plane but it uses things made by RTX and other defense companies.\n\nAnd this isn't something that you can easily fix. POTUS can promise to be nice and stay on his best behavior.... which I don't think he would even be willing to say let alone follow through on. But even if he did say it are militaries around the world going to want to have to rely on that? Can they risk having their nation's ability to defend itself hinge on the good will of someone who could favorably be described as inconsistent?\n\nI don't know if the collapse of the US defense sector will lead to a complete market crash. But I think it has a chance. Either way I'm confident something will do that and in the mean time LMT puts seem rife with opportunity at the moment.\n\nETA:\n\nThe USA is the biggest customer for the US arms industry, \\~70% of LMT's customers are right here in the USA:\n\nIn terms of my specific DD for this specific arms manufacturer at this specific moment in time - LMT is currently filling orders on what is the most expensive defense production run in human history. It is valued at over a trillion dollars for the life of the platform (from development, through production and to the end of post production support such as spare parts, software updates and maintenance). The vast majority of that mammoth expense was shouldered by the USA and funded design, development and early production. The plan originally was for many additional nations to place orders to meet per unit cost targets. But the system was just too expensive and there was actually a bit of a crisis from the early 2000's up until 2022 because the USA was basically the \\*only\\* customer which meant the entire cost of the project was on the USA. Then Russia invaded Ukraine and started doing war crimes in full view of satellites. Canada who had been on the fence for years suddenly ordered 88. The UK massively upped their order. A bunch of other nations in Europe and beyond placed or expanded orders and the cost per unit has plunged. All to say that the last 10 years have been all USA and the next 10 years were supposed to be mostly Europe, Middle East, South Asia, South East Asia, Australia/NZ, etc.\n\nAlso in general I am very bearish on many industries in the USA including defense\\*\n\n\\* [https://www.cnbc.com/2025/02/13/defense-stocks-drop-after-trump-says-defense-spending-could-be-halved.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/02/13/defense-stocks-drop-after-trump-says-defense-spending-could-be-halved.html)",
